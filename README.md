# Four is Magic

An interactive site exploring a neat property of English: **pick any number, count the letters in its name, and repeat. You always end up at 4.**

For example: 7 → "seven" (5 letters) → "five" (4 letters) → "four" (4 letters) → stuck forever.

## What's on the site

- **Try a Number** — type any number up to ~1 quadrillion and watch the chain step by step
- **Where Numbers Go** — an interactive force-directed graph showing how numbers flow to 4 (set your own range)
- **The Transition Table** — summary and detail views of where every number in your range maps to
- **Why Does This Always Work?** — an explanation of why 4 is an absorbing state
